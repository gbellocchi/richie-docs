    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richie</span> employs FPGAs:
        - as a target _acceleration medium_, leveraging a novel accelerator-rich overlay to simplify the offloading of critical application tasks to the AMD-Xilinx FPGA fabrics;
        - as an _HeSoC emulator_, not meant for actual application acceleration but for the accurate modelling of the target HW/SW system behaviour.
