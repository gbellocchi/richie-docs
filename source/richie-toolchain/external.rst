The contest outcome has been released as a `tutorial <https://github.com/gbellocchi/xil_open_hw_23>`_ to help you familiarize yourself with our work.

The HWPE Accelerator Interface
------------------------------
The `PULP platform <https://github.com/pulp-platform>`_ repository includes the components of the *Hardware Processing Engine* (*HWPE*) accelerator interface that :smallcap:`Richie` leverages: `Streamer <https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-stream>`_ and `Controller <https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-ctrl>`_.
An example design of a `HWPE-based MAC accelerator <https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-mac-engine>`_ - as well as its `testbench <https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-tb>`_ - are available as well. Both can be adopted as starting points to better understand the *design principles* and *functionalities* of the HWPE interface.
